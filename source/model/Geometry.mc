/*
Perspective offers a simple coordinate system over the coordinate system of the watch. It does the following:
- transform the coordinates of a point into its coordinates in a single point perspective projection
- transform these coordinates into the coordinates system of the watch
The axis system for Perspective is like the perpendicular symbol (‚ä•):
- the y-axis is a vertical line at the center of the perspective (the only line that is perfectly vertical in the perspective) and ranges from 0 at the front to 1 at the back
- the x-axis is an horizontal line at the front (the baseline of the perspective) and ranges from -0.5 far left to 0.5 far right
